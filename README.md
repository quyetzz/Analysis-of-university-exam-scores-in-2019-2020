Collect data from website, clean them, EDA (analyze them), visualize them on chart. Finally, the hypothetical statistics
First we will collect the data. Note that our data is very dirty and has never been cleaned, let's observe the data retrieval and read it after we have cleaned it up. Then, doing data analysis here, we analyze the average score for each subject for each candidate. Natural sciences score, social sciences score. And the group of people who did not take or quit the test meant they did not have a score, the average score by age group. Then visualize them
Next we transform the data, we can transform them, further standardizing our data model so we can do machine learning.
Use your knowledge of statistics to make 3 hypotheses that you want to choose and then select them or confirm that they are correct.
